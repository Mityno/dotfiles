This repo contains my dotfiles, although there are only few of them for now.

I mainly use kitty as terminal and zsh as shell. Nvim is my editor which I mostly use alongside the Neovide GUI.

Note that since I used to have a separate repository for my nvim configuration, it is here added as a submodule.
